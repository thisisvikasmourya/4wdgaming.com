            Nazara Technologies Ltd.
          </p>
          <p>Hands-on Nazara – India’s first Gaming IPO</p>
          <p className="py-1">
            We started working with the company since 2016 with one aim – to
            create perception of Nazara being the leading gaming company in the
            country.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The primary role was to attract investors and funding for the
            company with the right messaging throughout the media space.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            SD devised a focused PR program to target bi-monthly coverage in
            leading Indian business newspapers and publications like Economic
            Times, Mint, YourStory, Inc42 and even the largest mainstream
            newspaper of India, Times of India. With consistent coverage, in
            just 2 years’ time, Nazara managed 3 investors including known names
            like IIFL and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            News features, industry stories, management profiling in various
            columns and entrepreneurial magazines were carried out. The company
            and its management featured in practically every print publication
            on the key target list in addition to top online news blogs and
            shows and interviews in top TV channels.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The consistent push of well curated, specific communication played a
            big role for Nazara’s positioning, as it attracted 2 more sizable
            investments over the course of next 3 years and ultimately became
            the first Indian gaming company to open for public offering (IPO) in
            March, 2021. The testimony to its success is further proved by the
            fact that after a successful launch, the IPO was subscribed 175
            times in 3 days.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The advisory, over the years, had ensured the company and
            management’s presence among investors, at notable thought leadership
            events, in addition to bagging recognitions with big media banners.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            We are proud to have been instrumental in contributing to Nazara’s
            growth story today.

            Yudiz Solutions Ltd was a lesser-known entity in the constantly
            emerging and competitive tech market. Their aim was to launch their
            IPO in a couple of months and build awareness of their brand and
            plans going ahead.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            This was an excellent opportunity after having handled the Nazara
            Technologies IPO. This is the first IPO with the combined presence
            in the blockchain, AI and gaming and the second in the gaming space
            after Nazara Technologies IPO.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            As part of our PR plans, we strategically started with reworking the
            brand positioning and creating brand awareness, publicity, and
            attention towards the company in the media with the aim to bring out
            credibility and market readiness for the upcoming IPO.

          <p className="py-1">
            Sharing of profiles and establishing key relationships in the media,
            with their constant presence in top business publications like FE,
            Mint, and including TV and blogs among other investor-specific
            media. With regular features and impactful thought leadership
            opportunities across the country alongside other industry experts,
            we managed a strong presence for the company as a leading tech brand
            in the country.

            Trade Fantasy Game (TFG)

          {/* <p>Hands-on Nazara – India’s first Gaming IPO</p> */}
          <p className="py-1">
            Indian International Cricketer Deepak Chahar was all set to launch
            his premier fantasy platform to take on leading players like Dream
            11, My 11 circle, My Fab 11, among others. With the strategy of
            showcasing Deepak Chahar as a brand ambassador and entrepreneur, we
            took on the challenge of spearheading the PR campaign for the
            launch.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The objective for the launch was to create awareness for TFG (Trade
            Fantasy Game) in the fantasy space and the cricketer community. We
            successfully achieved this by planning the right positioning and
            product understanding, the vision and ambitions of TFG. This helped
            us in putting across the right messaging through PR.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The challenge was to not only to introduce Deepak Chahar but also
            Jaya Chahar who was going to be the CEO and take the business
            forward and play the official spokesperson for the brand. We managed
            interviews featuring Jaya Chahar in key business publications
            including print in ET, Moneycontrol, Inc 42 and top games of skill
            publications. This was with the strategic thought to build publicity
            and prominence as the spokesperson going forward in the business
            space.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            A multi-launch strategy with geographies across the country was
            undertaken considering the larger audience base for fantasy games in
            Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. Media output was excellent as the TFG launch
            announcement reached not only the metropolitan cities of the country
            but also most of the tier 2 and 3 cities with the best business
            papers, key language media and gaming media covering the news. The
            brand managed to get 50 k sign-ups within the first few weeks
            itself.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            4WD Gaming was proactive to provide the best advice at times of
            unforeseen situations ensuring brand reputation and positive
            publicity along with guidance and training to the spokesperson. We
            also placed TFG amongst market leaders and developed brand
            visibility in key industry stories and television around decisions
            from MeitY.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            TFG, while still an early entrant, has now managed to mark its
            presence and at par with other leading fantasy platforms given its
            share of voice in the media.

            Developed by Chennai based Nextwave Multimedia Pvt. Ltd., the World

            However, it was majorly known to the gamers and not the general
            milieu or the media. When Sharmilee Daru PR took over the mandate
            for the brand and IP, the scenario changed, for good. With repeated,
            meaningful messaging, the brand’s perception was established in the
            media and overall space to what it rightly deserved – as The Largest
            Mobile Cricket Game in the world.

            The studio, it’s spokesperson and the product quickly grabbed
