            Nazara Technologies Ltd.
          </p>
          <p>Hands-on Nazara – India’s first Gaming IPO</p>
          <p className="py-1">
            When 4WD GAMING, India&apos;s premier gaming PR, Web3 gaming PR, and
            Esports PR consultancy, partnered with Nazara Technologies Ltd., a
            leading gaming company, in 2016, our mission was clear - to
            establish Nazara as the foremost gaming brand in India and attract
            investors and funding through strategic PR initiatives.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            Our hands-on approach to PR began with a focused PR program
            targeting bi-monthly coverage in leading Indian business newspapers
            and publications, including Economic Times, Mint, YourStory, Inc42,
            and even the prestigious Times of India. By strategically crafting
            news features, industry stories, and management profiling, we
            ensured Nazara&apos;s consistent presence in the media space,
            captivating the attention of potential investors.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            As pioneers in gaming PR, we were committed to showcasing
            Nazara&apos;s potential to the gaming industry. With dedicated
            efforts, we attracted investments from renowned names like IIFL and
            Rakesh Jhunjhunwala within just two years.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            Our strategic PR initiatives expanded beyond print publications to
            encompass top online news blogs, TV channels, and interviews,
            amplifying Nazara&apos;s brand reach across diverse media platforms.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The seamless execution of well-curated communication played a
            pivotal role in enhancing Nazara&apos;s perception as a gaming
            leader, leading to two more substantial investments over the next
            three years. This positioning culminated in a groundbreaking
            achievement - Nazara became the first Indian gaming company to go
            public with its highly successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) in
            March 2021. The response was phenomenal, with the IPO being
            subscribed 175 times in a mere three days.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            Our strategic advisory further elevated Nazara&apos;s prominence
            through participation in notable thought leadership events, securing
            media recognitions, and positioning the company for continued
            growth.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            As gaming specialists with a deep understanding of the Indian gaming
            ecosystem, our dedication and expertise have contributed
            significantly to Nazara&apos;s remarkable growth story, firmly
            establishing them as a trailblazer in the gaming industry.

          <p className="py-1">
            Trade Fantasy Game (TFG), a premier fantasy platform set to compete
            with industry giants like Dream 11, My 11 circle, and My Fab 11, had
            a powerful ace up its sleeve - Indian International Cricketer Deepak
            Chahar. Tasked with showcasing Deepak Chahar as the brand ambassador
            and entrepreneur, 4WD GAMING eagerly embraced the challenge of
            spearheading the PR campaign for TFG&apos;s grand launch.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            Our primary objective was to create awareness for TFG in the highly
            competitive fantasy gaming space and among cricket enthusiasts.
            Through strategic planning, we emphasized the brand&apos;s vision,
            ambitions, and unique product offerings, ensuring the right
            messaging reached the target audience through effective PR channels.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            The launch had an additional challenge - introducing Jaya Chahar as
            the CEO and official spokesperson for TFG, taking the business
            forward. With a calculated approach, we secured interviews featuring
            Jaya Chahar in prominent business publications like ET,
            Moneycontrol, Inc 42, and leading games of skill publications. This
            strategic move aimed to build her publicity and prominence as the
            voice of the brand.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            To maximize reach, we executed a multi-launch strategy, targeting
            geographies across the country, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities
            with a substantial fantasy gaming audience. Our efforts paid off as
            TFG&apos;s launch announcement echoed not only in metropolitan
            cities but also reached a vast audience in Tier 2 and 3 cities
            through top business papers, key language media, and dedicated
            gaming media coverage. The response was phenomenal, with the brand
            witnessing 50,000 sign-ups within the initial weeks.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            As proactive advisors, 4WD GAMING ensured TFG&apos;s brand
            reputation remained unscathed during unforeseen situations. We
            provided guidance and training to the spokesperson, positioning TFG
            among market leaders and enhancing its brand visibility through key
            industry stories and television features, particularly around
            decisions from MeitY.
          </p>
          <p className="py-1">
            Though a relatively early entrant, TFG has swiftly carved its niche,
            standing tall among leading fantasy platforms, thanks to its share
            of voice in the media and resonating presence in the gaming
            community.
